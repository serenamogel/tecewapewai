He was 18 years old on his voyage, making him the youngest and first teenager to fly to space.</p><p>Daemen is well-known for going to space with <strong>Amazon CEO</strong> J<strong>eff Bezos</strong> and his brother <strong>Mark Bezos </strong>after winning a <strong>$28 million</strong> auction ticket. After all, he became the world's first paying client and the youngest person to travel to space.</p><h2>Oliver Daemen's Family Background</h2><p>Oliver Daemen is a pure white Caucasian ethnic group. Besides that, Oliver is his parents' youngest kid. He is the son of father&nbsp;<strong>Joes Daemen&nbsp;</strong>and mother,&nbsp;<strong>Eline Daemen Dekker</strong>.

And his mother works at <i>Somerset Capital Partners </i>as an ambassador.</p><p>His mother, on the other hand, is a former team member of <i>KLM Royal Dutch Airlines</i>. He was born into a well-established business family where families have a good time together, sharing joyful moments.</p><h2>How Was Oliver Daeman Chosen?</h2><p>Amazon's founder, Jeff Bezos, and the author of Blue Origin, recently organized a space trip called Blue Origin Spaceflight, which he will take alongside his brother and one other person. Blue Origin Spaceflight devised a strategy to carry a passenger on a corporate space mission with them, picked through a closeout.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2021/8/21/219836457_4220677864676779_3124120903391950556_n%20(1)-min-1629569751798.jpg><p>The teenager's dad had bought the ticket for New Shepard's second human flight, but Blue Origin moved him up when a seat became available on the first flight. Instead of traveling himself, the CEO of <strong>Somerset Capital Partners</strong> handed his heart to his son. Instead, the winner of the public auction will fly on the second trip. The business has not published the cost of Daemen's seat on New Shepard.</p><p>Surprisingly, an 18-year-old boy called Oliver Daemen won the competition, making him the <a href=# rel=nofollow>youngest person to ever travel</a> to space.</p><h2>What is Oliver Daemen's Relationship Status?
