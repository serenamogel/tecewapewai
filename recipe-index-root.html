But before we go to salad town, I thought I’d share this pile-of-vegetable pizza recipe that I made before we left. Usually&nbsp;my opinion about pizza is “less is more,” but I had a fridge to clean out. The crust here is made with part white whole wheat flour, but if you can use all whole wheat or all all-purpose flour if you prefer. Or skip the…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Soup is my favorite thing to make regardless of the season – it’s comfy and cozy in the fall and winter, but just because it’s 100 degrees outside now doesn’t mean I don’t crave soup in the summer. Enter: gazpacho. This one is extra healthy (and bikini-season-friendly) because it’s made with green juice as the base. Since working on these recipes, with Evolution Fresh, I’ve been inspired to incorporate more green juices into my cooking. I got this idea by reading the ingredient list for&nbsp;their&nbsp;Sweet Greens and Ginger&nbsp;cold-pressed juice. It’s full of&nbsp;cucumber, apple,&nbsp;and ginger (among other greens), and sounded like&nbsp;the…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Ciao from Italia! At the moment, our life is all about pizza, pasta and tomatoes. It’s amazing but every time I travel, the things I miss&nbsp;most are tacos and mexican-ish food.&nbsp;We made these quesadillas a few weeks ago but I could totally go for one right now! I often get questions about how to cook eggplant. My favorite and most foolproof method for&nbsp;non-spongy eggplant is to grill it. (If you don’t have an outdoor grill, you can use a grill pan on your stove). I grill mine&nbsp;simply with olive oil, salt and pepper, and a squeeze of lemon or drizzle…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>To say that we’re obsessed with cold brew coffee is an understatement. It’s the only coffee we drink at home now – the only reason we still own a coffee maker (which is now stored up on the highest shelf) is for when parents come to visit. I didn’t know it was possible to make cold brew yourself, but it’s more than possible, it’s easy. I’ve been buying my cold brew by the bottle, but when&nbsp;I started seeing homemade versions all over the internet (here, here, here, here), I was intrigued. But let’s back up –&nbsp;what is cold brew coffee…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>First, thank you all SO much for your Italy foodie suggestions, the other day!&nbsp;They are all so so helpful. I’m writing this from&nbsp;the terrace of our small, yet very awesome, airbnb apartment in Rome. It’s picturesque, I’m not going to lie. What’s less idyllic is&nbsp;this jet lag. I always expect it to get easier, but every trip&nbsp;it seems to hurt a little more… of course, nothing I’m sure a little gelato won’t fix. Before we head out for the day, I wanted to share this simple peach salad I made a few weeks ago with the sweetest Texas peaches &…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>This green pineapple smoothie has become my most recent breakfast kick. It’s super fresh, vibrant, and healthy, and it leaves me feeling energized at the start of the day. Between&nbsp;all the food that’s been around during our cookbook testing&nbsp;and all of the food I’m about to eat in Italy – I’ve tried to clean (and green) things up over the last few weeks. Cheesecakes and pizzas aside,&nbsp;I’ve gotten back to my salad-ey lunches and green drink routines. So it was perfect timing that Tess Masters (a.k.a The Blender Girl) sent me a copy of her new book&nbsp;The Blender Girl Smoothies.…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>If you’ve been following for long, you know that I have a slight obsession for all things that are mini. Mini skillets, mini pies, mini tacos – but my absolute favorite small food&nbsp;has to be mini pizzas. They’re quick and easy to make and a fun way to try lots of different&nbsp;toppings. These would be great for a summer party&nbsp;– you could even toss these little guys on the grill if you don’t want to heat up your house. The first step to your mini pizza party is mini naan – I buy Stonefire Mini Naan all the time –…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>The other day, I had this intense craving for cheesecake. The timing was a little out of the blue since I eat cheesecake exactly once a year when my mom makes it at&nbsp;christmas time. She makes a family recipe – my Grandma Kissel’s infamous recipe&nbsp;– and no one but&nbsp;her and&nbsp;my Aunt Kathy have&nbsp;it. It’s amazingly creamy and light and perfect and it won’t be getting passed down to me anytime soon. I wasn’t going to attempt to make sub-par cheesecake to satisfy my craving,&nbsp;so I made a lighter and altogether easier no-bake version. I’m not going to exactly call this…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Lately I’ve been reading&nbsp;all kinds of summer bucket lists that are floating around the internet. I enjoy them – they inspire me to get away from the computer and&nbsp;do fun things like hang out at&nbsp;pools with popsicles. (which I haven’t actually done, but the idea&nbsp;still lifts my spirit). For me, summer +&nbsp;list-making don’t go hand-in-hand, so I’ll just make one goal and that is to eat ALL of the peaches. I freaking love peaches. Their season is happening here and now in Texas so I’m&nbsp;I making&nbsp;the most of it with things like&nbsp;peach salads, peach salsa, and peach pops, just to…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>This blog may be mostly healthy, but I have to admit that I enjoy my share of fried foods from time to time. Fried oysters, fried shrimp – I love it all, even if it’s “sometimes food.” That is until now, because these baked oyster mushrooms are every bit as crispy, meaty, and delectable as anything fried. They’re easy to make, they’re healthy, and there’s no messy fry oil involved. I’ll just go ahead and say it – if you make one recipe this summer, make this one. These mushrooms are so delicious stuffed into a soft baguette with a&nbsp;slather…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>In a few weeks, Jack and I are headed to Rome where we will&nbsp;unapologetically eat gelato and pasta every day. We’ll tell ourselves we’re&nbsp;“walking it off,” and that “walk” will most definitely be on our way to the&nbsp;next meal. Until then, I’m making an effort to&nbsp;lighten things up. Conveniently, zucchini is in season so “zoodles” make for a fun vegetable-focused spin on regular pasta… First off – you don’t need&nbsp;to go out and buy a&nbsp;spiralizer to make these. If you’re going to invest in&nbsp;a gadget, I highly recommend the julienne peeler because it’s inexpensive, works great, and is small enough…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbvVnpinnJyaurC60meaqKVfmK61scaoqbJnopqwqrzEZqCnnJWterO7zq1mrJ2RqLyve8%2Banp5naWp8</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./all-the-memorable-disney-channel-christmas-episodes-on-disney-plus.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="All the memorable Disney Channel Christmas episodes on Disney Plus">&larr;
