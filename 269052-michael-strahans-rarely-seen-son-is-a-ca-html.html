The third seemed to be a friend of Michael Sr.</p><p class=dh>Another picture the former NFL star shared was one that captured him posing with his twin daughters, who wore happy smiles, glad to be able to enjoy more time with their beloved papa.</p><p class=dh>It is no secret that Michael enjoys spending time with all four of his children, and this vacation is just one of many he has taken with them in tow, and when he is not taking exotic trips with them, they actively participate in relatively mundane activities like enjoying dinner together.</p><p class=dh>His Instagram page is filled with photos that immortalized such moments.

The two met when he was 17 and living in Germany, where his father was stationed.</p><p class=dh>He was 20 when they tied the knot in 1992 and had two kids together before their divorce in 1996 after four years of marriage. They remained close friends as they made efforts to co-parent their children who stayed behind in Germany with their mother.</p><p class=dh>Despite the split, Michael made sure to keep up with his responsibilities as a father, constantly shuttling between Germany and the US to make memories with his kids. When they got old enough, they attended high school in Houston, Texas, Strahan’s hometown.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>SECOND ATTEMPT WITH JEAN MUGGLI</strong></p><p class=dh>Michael found love again — or thought he did — with a woman he met at a salon.

After he filed for divorce, she claimed he had domestically abused her after an argument over money.</p><p class=dh>He also denied the accusation, and in a statement he released at the time, he revealed his desire to end the marriage “and with dignity.” Most of 2020 passed with the two battling over who gets custody of their daughters.</p><p class=dh>They finally <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://pagesix.com/2020/11/06/michael-strahan-settles-claims-ex-wife-abused-their-twins/>settled</a>, in November 2020, for a shared custody arrangement that sees them alternate weeks of living with the girls. So far, it seems to have been working out.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>TANITA STRAHAN</strong></p><p class=dh>Tanita is Michael’s eldest child and daughter. She was the only daughter he had with his first wife and was born the year before he was drafted to the New York Giants.</p><p class=dh>She is an artist who enjoys painting and sharing her works on her social media feeds.
