Talking to a media person, Tilak’s father revealed that he had never seen his son play cricket before this. He said,<br><p>We had never been to a venue to watch him play. Even when he was leading Hyderabad in age-group tournaments, we avoided being at the ground. But this time, he requested us and we are here to enjoy his game. Going by his commitment and hard work, I am confident he will make the most of opportunities.”</p><p>His mother said,</p><p>I am very happy today as we are here to watch his first IPL match.

So he said that he would buy a new one, but could not buy it for a long time. I then continued to play with the same broken bat. With the broken bat I made the highest runs in U-16 cricket. When my coach saw this, he bought me everything I needed.

My coach started tearing up when the bids kept going higher. After I was picked up, I called up my parents. They too started crying over the call. My mother was struggling to get words out. Papa was unable to talk at all. I said that I have been selected for Mumbai Indians. I too had no idea what to say! Then I said that I am disconnecting the phone. It was the most emotional moment of my life.”</p></li></ul><ul><li readability=1.5>During an interview, Tilak revealed that he wanted to purchase a house for his parents with his IPL remuneration. He said,<br><p>Growing up, we’ve had a lot of financial difficulties. My father with his meagre salary had to look after my cricket expenses as well as my elder brother’s studies. In the last few years, with some sponsorship and match fees, I could just about take care of my cricketing expenses. We don’t own a house as yet. So with whatever I have earned in this IPL, my only aim is to get a house for my parents. This IPL money gives me the luxury to play freely for the rest of my career.”</p></li></ul><ul><li readability=2>In an interview, Tilak’s father described his (Tilak’s) everyday routine while Varma was an Under-14 player. He said,<br><p>There were difficult times, but a lot of people helped us, like his coach Salam Bayash sir. When he was an U-14 player, he used to practise and play matches at Uppal [Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium]. We needed to wake up at 4 am to reach the ground, which is 30km away from our home. I had to drop him and attend to my work and used to pick him up in the evenings. Those five years were hard, but the efforts have paid off.”</p></li></ul><ul class="related_post wp_rp"><li data-position=0 data-poid=ex-in_371263 data-post-type=own_sourcefeed><a href=# class=wp_rp_thumbnail><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/starsunfolded.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Pravin-Tambe-150x150.jpg alt="Pravin Tambe Height, Age, Wife, Children, Family, Biography & More" width=150 height=150 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><a href=# class=wp_rp_title>Pravin Tambe Height, Age, Wife, Children, Family, Biography & More</a></li><li data-position=1 data-poid=ex-in_366699 data-post-type=own_sourcefeed><a href=# class=wp_rp_thumbnail><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/starsunfolded.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Ravi-Kumar-150x150.jpg alt="Ravi Kumar (Cricketer) Height, Age, Girlfriend, Family, Biography & More" width=150 height=150 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><a href=# class=wp_rp_title>Ravi Kumar (Cricketer) Height, Age, Girlfriend, Family, Biography & More</a></li><li data-position=2 data-poid=ex-in_366629 data-post-type=own_sourcefeed><a href=# class=wp_rp_thumbnail><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/starsunfolded.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Nishant-Sindhu-150x150.jpg alt="Nishant Sindhu Height, Age, Family, Biography & More" width=150 height=150 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><a href=# class=wp_rp_title>Nishant Sindhu Height, Age, Family, Biography & More</a></li><li data-position=3 data-poid=ex-in_366337 data-post-type=own_sourcefeed><a href=# class=wp_rp_thumbnail><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/starsunfolded.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Dinesh-Bana-150x150.jpg alt="Dinesh Bana Age, Height, Girlfriend, Family, Biography & More" width=150 height=150 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><a href=# class=wp_rp_title>Dinesh Bana Age, Height, Girlfriend, Family, Biography & More</a></li><li data-position=4 data-poid=ex-in_366353 data-post-type=own_sourcefeed><a href=# class=wp_rp_thumbnail><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/starsunfolded.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Shaik-Rasheed-150x150.jpg alt="Shaik Rasheed Height, Age, Family, Biography & More" width=150 height=150 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><a href=# class=wp_rp_title>Shaik Rasheed Height, Age, Family, Biography & More</a></li><li data-position=5 data-poid=ex-in_359810 data-post-type=own_sourcefeed><a href=# class=wp_rp_thumbnail><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/starsunfolded.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Sadiq-Kirmani-photo-150x150.jpg alt="Sadiq Kirmani Height, Age, Girlfriend, Wife, Children, Family, Biography & More" width=150 height=150 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><a href=# class=wp_rp_title>Sadiq Kirmani Height, Age, Girlfriend, Wife, Children, Family, Biography & More</a></li><li data-position=6 data-poid=ex-in_359487 data-post-type=own_sourcefeed><a href=# class=wp_rp_thumbnail><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/starsunfolded.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Rohan-Gavaskar-picture-150x150.jpg alt="Rohan Gavaskar Height, Age, Girlfriend, Wife, Children, Family, Biography & More" width=150 height=150 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><a href=# class=wp_rp_title>Rohan Gavaskar Height, Age, Girlfriend, Wife, Children, Family, Biography & More</a></li><li data-position=7 data-poid=ex-in_359379 data-post-type=own_sourcefeed><a href=# class=wp_rp_thumbnail><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/starsunfolded.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Sunil-Valson-150x150.jpg alt="Sunil Valson Height, Age, Wife, Children, Family, Biography & More" width=150 height=150 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><a href=# class=wp_rp_title>Sunil Valson Height, Age, Wife, Children, Family, Biography & More</a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpJa%2FtMHNn6alnJWZe6S7zGiroqSRoHq3rdGmmGg%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./saint-x-based-on-true-story.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Is Saint X Based On True Story?">&larr;
