His victims, who were often raped and strangled, included short-term acquaintances, sex workers and a girlfriend. He left bodies in Oregon, California, Florida, Nebraska and Washington while working as a long-haul truck driver. Before he was identified as a serial killer, he anonymously confessed to his crimes in messages that contained smiley faces, leading to his being nicknamed the "Happy Face Killer." In addition to murder, Jesperson's criminal history included animal cruelty, arson and sexual assault. He had a relationship with his final victim and became a suspect after her body was discovered in March 1995. He confessed to killing her and subsequently admitted to seven other murders.</p><h2 data-node-id=3 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Early Life</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Jesperson was born on April 6, 1955, in British Columbia, Canada. Jesperson was a middle child, with an older sister and brother and a younger sister and brother. His father often punished Jesperson by hitting him with a leather belt. Jesperson grew up in Chilliwack, Canada before moving to Selah, Washington with his family when he was 12.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">At school, Jesperson was bigger than his classmates and was taunted with names like "Monster Man" and "Igor." As a child, he was cruel to animals – he killed cats and snakes and, under the guise of hunting, inflicted pain on creatures like deer, rabbits, and coyotes.</p><h2 data-node-id=7 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Victims</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Jesperson's first victim, 23-year-old Taunja Bennett, was killed on January 21, 1990. He met the developmentally disabled Bennett while out drinking and convinced her to go to his house. There, he assaulted, beat and strangled her.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In the summer of 1992, Jesperson met "Claudia" at a truck checkpoint in California. Her body, which had been strangled and tied up with duct tape, was found on August 30, 1992. Her identity remains unknown.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Jesperson murdered another woman in August 1992 at a Turlock, California truck stop. This victim has been identified as Cynthia Lynn (Rose) Wilcox. However, Jesperson<a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://books.google.com/books?id=lkZMDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT288" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=" later said" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10"> later said</a> he actually killed another woman and did not recognize Wilcox's photo.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In November 1992, Jesperson had an encounter with sex worker Laurie Anne Pentland at a truck stop. He strangled her and left her corpse in Oregon.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Remains found in Merced County, California on June 3, 1993, belonged to a Jesperson victim he has said was called "Cindy." They met at a truck stop in Corning, California. Her real name remains a mystery.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In September 1994, the body of a woman was found in Florida. Her actual identity is unknown, but "Susanna" — which Jesperson has stated may have been her name — was confirmed to be one of his victims because he knew about the tie wraps found around her throat.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Soon after Angela Subrize ran into Jesperson at a bar in Spokane, Washington in January 1995, she traveled east with him in his truck. He has said he strangled her<a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.spokesman.com/stories/1996/jan/16/jesperson-admits-slaying-woman-he-met-in-spokane/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=" because she wouldn't let him sleep" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10"> because she wouldn't let him sleep</a>. After the murder, Jesperson remembered they'd spent days together and he'd let her use a credit card. He<a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://books.google.com/books?id=qlqDlAmlk1IC&pg=PA271" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=" decided" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10"> decided</a> to drag her body underneath his truck to impede identification. He left her remains in Nebraska, though Subrize was likely killed in Wyoming.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Jesperson's last victim was Julie Winningham, who'd been his girlfriend. She was killed in Washington state on March 10, 1995, and her body was discovered the next day.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Jesperson<a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://books.google.com/books?id=lpu0t3_B-GQC&pg=PA324" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=" has said" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10"> has said</a> that he took 166 lives, but only the above eight murders have been attributed to him. In April 1990, he sexually assaulted a woman who managed to escape.<a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://books.google.com/books?id=sllkbf3qRMkC&pg=PA167" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=" According to Jesperson" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10"> According to Jesperson</a>, after he killed his fifth victim in 1993 he managed to stave off murderous urges for more than a year by committing arson while on the road as a trucker.</p><h2 data-node-id=17 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Becoming the Happy Face Killer</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Following the discovery of Bennett's body in January 1990, Laverne Pavlinac lied to police that she'd aided her boyfriend John Sosnovske in committing the crime. Pavlinac made this false statement because she <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/11/26/us/evidence-clears-two-the-law-doesn-t.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="wanted to escape" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">wanted to escape</a> her abusive relationship with Sosnovske. She later rescinded her confession, but in 1991 a jury still found her guilty. Sosnovske pleaded guilty to avoid the death penalty.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">These convictions meant Jesperson was unlikely to ever face charges for his crime. However, a part of him<a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://abcnews.go.com/2020/daughter-serial-killer-tells-happy-face-killer/story?id=11413812" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=" wanted to claim credit" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10"> wanted to claim credit</a>, so he wrote about murdering Bennett in a bus terminal bathroom. The message was signed with a smiley face. He would go on to share details of the crime on other restroom walls.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In later years, Jesperson also sent anonymous letters to The Oregonian newspaper about what had become his multiple murders. Smiley faces again served as his signature, prompting a journalist to dub Jesperson the "Happy Face Killer."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After Jesperson was in custody, he provided the location of Bennett's purse, which only the killer would know. Authorities came to believe they had convicted the wrong people. Pavlinac and Sosnovske were released from prison in November 1995.</p><h2 data-node-id=22 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Capture</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Jesperson became a suspect after Winningham's was found since he was known to be her boyfriend. Jesperson attempted suicide but ended up confessing to Winningham's murder. Before his arrest, he also wrote a letter to his brother that <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.deseret.com/1995/8/10/19186887/suspect-s-letter-says-he-killed-8-people data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=admitted class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">admitted</a>, "I am sorry that I turned out this way. I have been a killer for five years and have killed eight people." His brother gave this letter to law enforcement.</p><h2 data-node-id=24 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Sentence</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">While in custody, Jesperson shared details of his eight murders. He received multiple life sentences for several of these crimes but was spared the death penalty.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Jesperson resides in the Oregon State Penitentiary, where he spends much of his time making art. Pieces of his artwork have been seen on "murderabilia" sites.</p><h2 data-node-id=27 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Personal Life</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Jesperson married Rose Hucke on August 2, 1975. They had three children, two girls and a boy. They divorced in 1989.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">His older daughter has <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://abcnews.go.com/2020/daughter-serial-killer-tells-happy-face-killer/story?id=11413812" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=described class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">described</a> witnessing acts of animal cruelty that included Jesperson killing kittens.</p><h2 data-node-id=30 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Movies and Books</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">A television movie, Happy Face Killer, starring David Arquette as Jesperson, aired in 2014.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The book I: the Creation of a Serial Killer (2002), by Jack Olsen, delved into Jesperson's life. M. William Phelps penned a memoir about his interactions with Jesperson: Dangerous Ground: My Friendship with a Serial Killer (2017).</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=33 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Melissa G. Moore, Jesperson's older daughter, wrote Shattered Silence: The Untold Story of a Serial Killer’s Daughter (2009). She also examined her father's actions in the podcast Happy Face.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=34 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10"><a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.lifetimemovieclub.com/?cmpid=LMC_Bio_keith_hunter_jesperson" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Watch Happy Face Killer on Lifetime Movie Club" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Watch Happy Face Killer on Lifetime Movie Club</a></p><ul data-node-id=38 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Birth Year: 1955</li><li>Birth date: April 6, 1955</li><li>Birth City: British Columbia</li><li>Birth Country: Canada</li><li>Best Known For: Serial killer Keith Hunter Jesperson, also known as the "Happy Face Killer," brutally murdered eight women between 1990 and 1995.</li></ul><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=40 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">We strive for accuracy and fairness.If you see something that doesn't look right,<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/page/contact-us data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="contact us" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">contact us</a>!</p><br data-node-id=42><ul data-node-id=44 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Article Title: Keith Hunter Jesperson Biography</li><li>Author: Biography.com Editors</li><li>Website Name: The Biography.com website</li><li>Url: https://www.biography.com/crime-figure/keith-hunter-jesperson</li><li>Access Date:</li><li>Publisher: A&E Television Networks</li><li>Last Updated: March 3, 2021</li><li>Original Published Date: February 2, 2021</li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o7XOoKmaqJiue6S7zGiaq6Gdmnysscitn2agpaPBpr6Mo5ysqJWnwLC6</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./chris-watts-wife-daughters-murder-mistress-confession-timeline.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="A Complete Timeline of the Murder of His Wife and Daughters">&larr;
