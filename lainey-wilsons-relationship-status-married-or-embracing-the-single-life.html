Everything to know here! &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Despite being a relatively newly introduced name in country music, <strong>Lainey Wilson</strong>, a singer-songwriter, is already taking the industry by storm. At the recent CMA Awards 2023, Wilson claimed the coveted Entertainer of the Year title, Female Vocalist of the Year and Album of the Year, leaving behind renowned nominees like <strong>Luke Comb, Carrie Underwood</strong>, and<strong> Miranda Lambert</strong>. &nbsp;</p><p>Born on May 19, 1992, in the small town of Baskin, Louisiana, Wilson moved to the musical city of Nashville as a high school graduate in search of a big break. For years, the small-town aspirant paid her dues, and it was only in 2020 that she garnered heavy media attention with her song, <i>Things a Man Oughta Know</i>. &nbsp;</p><h2>Who is Lainey Wilson Dating? &nbsp;</h2><p>2023 is Wilson's year, and that is, well, for many reasons. The Lousiana native, in addition to her slew of wins at the CMA recently, also embarked on her secondary career as an actress- Wilson was introduced on the fan-favourite Netflix show <i>Yellowstone</i> as a musical ranch hand called Abby. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/11/30/Snapinsta.app_399021083_18395793064037552_8928997449852648457_n_1080%20(1)%20(1)-1701374627761.jpg><p>Not only that, Lainey has also shared her personal life with fans, perhaps in an attempt to feel closer to them. Wilson released her hit single, <i>Heart Like a Truck</i>, in which she compares her heart to a truck that has taken a "hell of a beating." The CMA winner probably reflected on her past romantic experiences while penning the song because her current love life deserves only gushy lyrics. &nbsp;</p><p>Lainey's ardent fans might have assumed that the singer, a relatively new face in country music, would probably fall for a fellow country star, but it turns out not. The <i>Things a Man Oughta Know </i>hitmaker is dating an athlete, and it is none other than NFL's former hottie quarterback<strong> Devlin "Duck" Hodges. &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/11/30/Snapinsta.app_399645869_18395793091037552_7450254689777607408_n_1080%20(1)%20(1)-1701374633551.jpg><p>It is with immense joy that we divulged that Wilson, 31, has also found love amidst her flourishing, albeit demanding, career. The growing attention in Lainey's personal life came after the singer and her beau made their red carpet debut at the 2023 ACM Awards earlier this year. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The CMA-winning singer has since opened up about her romance with Hodges. Debunking the widely believed assumption that she and Devlin had just started dating, given their surprise couple entry at the ACM, Wilson revealed that their relationship is over two years old. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/11/30/Snapinsta.app_400165791_323244110333826_1637531314901732818_n_1080%20(1)%20(1)-1701374644716.jpg><p>During her appearance on the<i> The Bobby Bones Show,</i> the <i>Heart Like a Truck</i> crooner said, "He's been around for a while. I just decided to make him wait for two and a half years." While further touching on why she made poor Hodges wait for years before making it official, Wilson says she wanted to know if the NFL star was in the relationship for "the right reasons." "Turns out he is," Lainey quips. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Lainey has shared that it was while performing in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on Combs' world tour when it all started with Hodges. The country singer recalls fueling groundless dating rumours with Devlin after she and her bandmates sported Hodges' Steelers Jersey. Things reportedly escalated between the two after a flirty social media tease. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>"I just decided to make him wait for two and a half years," Lainey said while reflecting on her relationship with Devlin!&nbsp;</strong></p><figure class=media></figure><p>Alluding to her boyfriend's supportive nature, Lainey further gushes, saying, "Duck is the kind of dude who high-fives me on the way in the door and on the way out and says, 'Go get it,' <a href=#>adding,</a> "He knows how important this dream is to me."&nbsp;</p><h3>Get to Know Lainey Wilson's Boyfriend, Devlin "Duck" Hodges! &nbsp;</h3><p>Since the country star started to flaunt her blissful relationship, Lainey's fervent fans have been digging for more info about her "sweet" and supportive" boyfriend, Devlin "Duck" Hodges, who has been Wilson's rock for the past two years. Lainey's constant effusive words about Duck has already put him as a potential husband of the singer, making an elaborate introduction of him all more necessary. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/11/30/Snapinsta.app_317782355_688214269329141_7723153452091012292_n_1080%20(1)%20(1)-1701374651998.jpg><p>Lainey's beau, Hodges, 27, is a former NFL quarterback. A native of Kimberly, Alabama, Hodges, known as Duck amongst his fans, had a stellar collegiate career at Samford Bulldogs football, during which Devlin reportedly received his nickname, Duck.&nbsp;</p><p>Devlin was later signed as an undrafted free agent by the Pittsburgh Steelers in 2019 and by the Ottawa Redblacks in September 2021. Hodges shockingly announced his retirement from the NFL after a brief stint with the Redblacks in 2021. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/11/30/Snapinsta.app_346263274_983391859361397_3202329932075988089_n_1080%20(1)%20(1)-1701374665178.jpg><p>The Kimberly-born QB didn't cite any official reason behind his decision but reasserted his excitement about the future. "I'm excited to see what the future holds, but I know that the next chapter in my life is going to be fun," <a href=#>Hodges said</a> in his short statement.&nbsp;</p><p>The former quarterback has since ventured into real estate. As per sources, Devlin was last working at Mossy Oak Properties in Louisiana. Besides his short-lived NFL career and his recent real estate endeavour, Hodges is also a skilled hunter. &nbsp;</p><p>Stay connected to <a href=#>Married Celeb</a> for more.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae%2FqrHDnJylnZJjsLC5jqWYoqaVrnq4tcuspqerXaeyra3Toqanq5ievW6%2F05qrrqtdoq6zvsiem2anomKyrq7RmpqippdiwamxjKygp5%2BcmnqttcWe</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./lee-da-in-children-does-lee-da-in-have-children.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Lee Da-in Children: Does Lee Da-in Have Children?">&larr;
