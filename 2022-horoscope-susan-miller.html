But it's only natural to feel a bit wary given the amount of hope we had at the start of 2020 and 2021.... only to have it shattered by pandemics, stressful elections, insurrections, and violence.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">So we're turning to the world's most famous astrologer and the founder of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Astrology Zone</a>, Susan Miller, to give us a glimpse into what we can expect in 2022. You may recall that earlier this month, InStyle teamed up with Miller to develop four perfectly-curated<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2> beauty boxes</a> based on your elemental sign â€” <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>earth</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=4>air</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=5>fire</a>, and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=6>water</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you haven't ordered your Cosmic Collection Box yet (what are you waiting for?) they come with a special, exclusive 52-page booklet from Susan Miller that will lay the blueprint for your year ahead. The famed astrology expert goes into great depth about what each sign can expect in 2022 from start to finish. You'll have to purchase your box to get the whole prediction, but we'll give you a little sneak peek of the 2022 horoscopes for each sign here.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The <strong>Cosmic Collection</strong> is available now for $35 each at <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">thebeautyseason.com/instyle</a> while supplies last.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-capricorn-december-22-january-19></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Capricorn (December 22 - January 19)</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Emily Lundin</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">2022 has the potential to be a major year for you, dear Capricorn. The stakes will be high when it comes to an important new work project, but Jupiter (the planet of luck) will see to it that you sharpen your skills and negotiate well, too. Some lucky dates for you: February 4, when Mars is sextile to Jupiter, denoting the opportunity to put a plan into action and receive a profitable return, and September 25, when the new moon in your prestigious tenth house of fame and honors could bring a professional offer you'll find too good to pass up. Your love life will also sparkle brightly this year, including on February 16 when Venus and Mars, the two planets of love, conjoin in Capricorn, sending your magnetism sky high. This is fantastic for your romantic life, so look your best!</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-aquarius-january-20-february-18></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Aquarius (January 20 - February 18)</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Emily Lundin</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Be excited because 2022 is a lyrical, beautiful year with many rewards in store. Under Saturn's tutelage, you are being asked to tackle something new that takes concentration and commitment: it could be getting married, having a baby, starting a business, buying your first house, or starting graduate school. You also will have a chance to experience love and romance in the second half, straight into early 2023. Thanks to Venus, the planet of love and relationships, March 5th will be a particularly lucky day for you that could set off a brilliant spark of love between you and someone new, or if you are attached, bring back the kind of passion you enjoyed when you first met.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-pisces-february-19-march-20></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Pisces (February 19 - March 20)</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Emily Lundin</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">You have quite a sparkling year in 2022, dear Pisces. You are on the cusp of entering the best financial year in the decade â€” possibly of your entire life. You will have to be choosy about what career opportunities you accept, or run the risk of spreading yourself too thin. Even your health will improve, and by year's end, you will feel stronger than when you started. Your very best day to find love, or to buy new things to wear, will be April 30, for on that day, Jupiter and Venus will meet for the first time in your sign in a decade. If you are attached, you will slow down and concentrate on each other â€” giving your full attention to someone is one of the most heartfelt gifts you can give.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-aries-march-21-april-19></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Aries (March 21 - April 19)</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Emily Lundin</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After a tough couple of years, 2022 represents a time of expansion and optimism, Aries. Jupiter only comes 'round every 12 years, so you are starting a new and vital chapter in your life, affecting many areas. You will meet high-level people and make superb new contacts, including, possibly, a romantic interest that could be one you've long sought but wondered if you'd ever find. If you are single, take seriously those you meet now, even if you are not completely besotted on the first meeting. Jupiter in your own sign is considered the very best aspect possible to have to find true and lasting love.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-taurus-april-20-may-20></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Taurus (April 20 - May 20)</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_38-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Emily Lundin</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As you start 2022, Jupiter has moved into Pisces, and that's good news for you, bringing profits from work done the year before, particularly if you are self-employed. Jupiter in Pisces will greatly expand your circle of friends, contacts, and colleagues. And as the natural ruler of your solar eighth house of other people's money, these new friends and contacts will have a direct bearing on your ability to make money. For your very best chance to meet someone new, watch the new moon of August 27 in Virgo. Among the new friends you make, if you are single, one may become a serious romantic interest. It's a big year! Be ready!</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-gemini-may-21-june-20></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Gemini (May 21 - June 20)</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_44-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Emily Lundin</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The coming year will be one of the best years for your career in over a decade, with a cornucopia of professional opportunities you used to only dream about. The best months for professional progress will be when Jupiter tours Pisces from December 28, 2021 to May 10, 2022 â€” especially the new moon in Pisces on March 2 â€” and then again from October 27 to December 20. Matters of the heart will necessarily take a back seat in 2022, but once Jupiter moves into Aries, May 10 to October 27, you will have much more time for love and an enriched personal life and may realize a dream you've long wanted to achieve. This will be a fast-paced year. You will feel at times like you've had too much coffee, so build in breaks to unwind with friends over weekends or for dinner. You are moving up in the world dear Gemini, and there's no stopping you now. Get your outfits ready.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-cancer-june-21-july-22></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_49-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Cancer (June 21 - July 22)</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_50-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Emily Lundin</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_51-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">You have a very happy year ahead. For the first time in 12 years, fortunate Jupiter will be in Pisces, a water sign that blends perfectly with yours. The very best moment for your career comes on the Aries new moon on March 31, in your tenth house of career progress and prestige. Jupiter will also be "trine" the Sunâ€”a heavenly aspect, one of the best possible you could hope forâ€”boosting your health, optimism, and romantic allure. Venus will enter your sign on July 17 to remain until August 11. This is the time to socialize, buy new clothes, and focus on your appearance. After you have some new things, step outâ€” you will be dripping with charm, and few will be able to resist you. You have quite a year in store!</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-leo-july-23-august-22></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_55-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Leo (July 23 - August 22)</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_56-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Emily Lundin</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_57-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">This year, Leo, it feels like you've turned a corner. Financially you will do well, with potentially thrilling career breakthroughs. This is especially true in the weeks after the new moon of March 2, marking an especially pivotal month for financial gains. When it comes to romance, you will sparkle brightly starting on the gorgeous new moon on November 23, in your fifth house of true love, and for weeks after, just in time for holiday gatherings. Are you excited yet? You should be!</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-virgo-august-23-september-22></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_61-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Virgo (August 23 - September 22)</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_62-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Emily Lundin</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_63-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The past two years may have brought painful shifts in your life due to the pandemic, but the worst appears to be over. You have a big, happy year in store, with a possible commitment in love, a chance to scale great heights in your career, a generous amount of money pouring in, and improved work methods that make you more efficient and more productive. (FYI, if you are single, you will do best when Mars tours Capricorn, your house of true love, from January 24 to March 5.) In the second half of 2022, plenty of energy will be directed to your evolving, rising career, especially in September. Kick up your heels, you deserve this!</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-libra-september-23-october-22></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_67-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Libra (September 23 - October 22)</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_68-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Emily Lundin</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_69-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Something special is happening in 2022. Neptune will meet with Jupiter in Pisces on April 12 for the only time in your lifetime, adding grace and beauty to any professional project. There will also be a lovely time in February and March for fun and love and for meeting that special someone if single. (You can have fun then too, if attached!). On March 6, Mars and Venus will conjoin in Aquarius, your house of true love â€” a day that should certainly set off the sparks of great chemistry between you and someone special.

With benefic, lucky Jupiter entering Pisces, your solar fifth house, from December 28, 2021 to May 10, 2022, and again at the end of the year, you will enjoy one of the most glorious years of your life for romance, fun, creative expression, and children. Absolutely nothing will beat the happiness you'll feel in March. The luckiest day of the year is on March 5, when Jupiter conjuncts the mighty Sun. This only happens once a year, and it will be 12 years until it happens again in your fifth house of true love. As great as this day is for your love life, it will be hard to beat financially, too.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-sagittarius-november-22-december-21></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_79-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Sagittarius (November 22- December 21)</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_80-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Emily Lundin</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_81-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The year ahead will have a bright new quality to it. Adventurous Sagittarians can be a bit hesitant about the idea of commitment, but if you find a love interest who loves travel as much as you do, it could become a legendary match. If you've already found that person who inspires you, loves you, and wants to build a life with you, then Jupiter in Aries will help you spend more time together. Although this year will be more focused on the inner, private side of you than your public face, you will have opportunities to make a name for yourself. Watch developments that surface at the full moon of March 18, supported by lucrative Pluto in Capricorn. Much of what you've done in the recent past will now be rewarded, boosting your reputation. You have so much to get excited about for the year ahead!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57y6Kdnqukrrmme8Csq6unnKS0unuRaWlrZZikv7C%2FwqinnmWjqsCiuoymoKWklac%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./a-cry-in-the-dark-1988.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="A Cry in the Dark movie review (1988)">&larr;
