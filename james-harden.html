He requested a trade and later missed media day and the opening day of training camp. The former MVP didn’t appear in any of Philadelphia’s first three games this season, which began October 26.</p><h2 data-node-id=5 title="Who Is James Harden?" data-anchor-id=who-is-james-harden class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Who Is James Harden?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Basketball star James Harden, who plays for the Los Angeles Clippers, is known as much for his prominent beard as he is for his stellar play on the court. The No. 3 pick in the 2009 NBA draft, he began his career with the Oklahoma City Thunder before a stunning trade to the Houston Rockets in 2012. Harden has since emerged as a perennial MVP candidate and one of the top scorers in NBA history, ranking 25th all-time as of November 2023. Among his most notable accomplishments are a record-setting 60-point triple-double in a January 2018 game, as well as 23 <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/50-point-game-most-times.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="career 50-point games" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">career 50-point games</a>—fourth most in NBA history behind <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/athletes/wilt-chamberlain data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Wilt Chamberlain" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Wilt Chamberlain</a>, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/athletes/michael-jordan data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Michael Jordan" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Michael Jordan</a>, and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/athletes/kobe-bryant data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Kobe Bryant" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Kobe Bryant</a>.</p><h2 data-node-id=8 title="Quick Facts" data-anchor-id=quick-facts class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Quick Facts</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="body-tip css-i9osfz e1k3dme10">FULL NAME: James Edward Harden Jr.<br>BORN: August 26, 1989<br>BIRTHPLACE: Los Angeles, California<br>ASTROLOGICAL SIGN: Virgo</p><h2 data-node-id=10 title="Early Years" data-anchor-id=early-years class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Early Years</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">James Edward Harden Jr. was born on August 26, 1989, in Los Angeles. James Sr., a former Navy seaman, was mostly absent from his life, leading to Harden and his two siblings to be raised by their mom, Monja Willis, in the city’s Compton neighborhood.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">By the time James first tried out for the boys’ basketball team at Artesia High School in nearby Lakewood, he stood a relatively modest 6 feet, 1 inch, and was hampered by bouts of asthma. However, he immediately impressed his coaches with his game instincts, and after sprouting a few inches, he became one of the top players in the nation. Harden led Artesia to back-to-back state championships and was named a McDonald’s All-American in 2007.</p><h2 data-node-id=13 title="College Career at Arizona State" data-anchor-id=college-career-at-arizona-state class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">College Career at Arizona State</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">One of the most decorated recruits in Arizona State basketball history, Harden immediately helped turn around a program that sunk to an 8-22 record in 2006-07. The Sun Devils improved to 21 wins during Harden’s freshman season and surged to 25 wins and a berth in the NCAA Tournament by his third and final year. Named the Pac-10 Conference Player of the Year and an All-American, he wrapped up his collegiate career ranked third all-time in ASU’s record book with an average of 19.0 points per game. Later, Arizona State retired his No. 13 jersey.</p><h6 class="css-9e7625 e9ikml3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e9ikml1">Learn About Other NBA Stars</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><h2 data-node-id=16 title="NBA Teams" data-anchor-id=nba-teams class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">NBA Teams</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Harden has been in the NBA since the 2009-10 season and currently plays for the Los Angeles Clippers. His past teams include the Oklahoma City Thunder, Houston Rockets, Brooklyn Nets, and Philadelphia 76ers.</p><h2 data-node-id=18 class="body-h3 css-gna8ot e1k3dme10">Oklahoma City Thunder</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Selected by the Oklahoma City Thunder with the No. 3 overall pick in the 2009 NBA draft, Harden got his pro career off to a strong start by earning All-Rookie Second Team honors.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">By 2011-12, he was an integral part of a team that also featured superstar scorers <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/athletes/kevin-durant data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Kevin Durant" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Kevin Durant</a> and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/athletes/russell-westbrook data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Russell Westbrook" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Russell Westbrook</a>. Harden was named the winner of the NBA’s Sixth Man of the Year Award, and the Thunder rolled through the playoffs before suffering a tough five-game loss to <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/athletes/lebron-james data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="LeBron James" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">LeBron James</a> and the Miami Heat in the NBA Finals.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Capping his breakout season, Harden was a member of the gold-medal-winning U.S. Olympic team at the 2012 London Olympics.</p><h2 id=Emergence-with-the-Houston-Rockets data-node-id=22 class="body-h3 css-gna8ot e1k3dme10">Houston Rockets</h2><img alt="james harden dribbling a basketball in front of a defender during an nba game" title="James Harden has played for the Houston Rockets, Brooklyn Nets, and Philadelphia 76ers" width=1024 height=683 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/james-harden-of-the-houston-rockets-drives-to-the-basket-news-photo-1698787997.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j1">Getty Images</span><p>Houston Rockets guard James Harden (13) drives toward the basket during a 2019 game against the San Antonio Spurs.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In late October 2012, shortly before the start of the NBA season, the Thunder sent ripples through the league with the announcement that they were trading Harden to the Houston Rockets, reportedly over the inability of the two sides to come to terms on a contract.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In return, the Thunder received guard Kevin Martin, recent draft pick Jeremy Lamb, and multiple future draft picks, but the lack of an impact player to match the production of Harden resulted in the trade being viewed as heavily lopsided in favor of Houston.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After joining the Rockets prior to the 2012-13 season, Harden emerged as one of the top players in the NBA. He earned the first of six straight All-Star berths that year and finished second in the voting for Most Valuable Player in 2015 and 2017 before finally claiming the trophy in 2018.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">For all his individual brilliance, Harden was unable to push the Rockets past the pack of postseason contenders in his first few years with the team. Houston did reach the Western Conference Finals in 2015 but was bounced in the first round of the playoffs in 2016. The following year, another promising season halted in the playoffs’ second round.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">With <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/athletes/chris-paul data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Chris Paul" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Chris Paul</a> bringing his veteran leadership to the team, and key role players like Eric Gordon fitting nicely alongside Harden in his prime, the Rockets won an NBA-best 65 games in 2017-18, before suffering a heartbreaking loss to the Golden State Warriors in the Western Conference Finals. The following year, Harden lifted Houston out of an early hole with his unstoppable scoring ability, but the season again ended at the hands of the Warriors in the playoffs.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Harden won his third-straight scoring title with Houston in the 2019-20 season, which was suspended on March 11, 2020, at the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States and resumed later that summer in a contained “bubble” at the Walt Disney World resort in Florida. But after the Rockets fell to the Lakers in the second round, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/mike-dantoni-announces-he-will-not-return-as-rockets-coach-next-season/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="head coach Mike D’Antoni" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">head coach Mike D’Antoni</a> and general manager Daryl Morey left the team, and Harden eventually demanded a trade.</p><h2 data-node-id=30 class="body-h3 css-gna8ot e1k3dme10">Brooklyn Nets and Philadelphia 76ers</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">On January 24, 2021, Harden got his wish and was traded to the Brooklyn Nets, where he joined fellow superstars <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/athletes/kevin-durant data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Kevin Durant" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Kevin Durant</a> and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/athletes/kyrie-irving data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Kyrie Irving" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Kyrie Irving</a>. Harden averaged almost 25 points in 36 games with his new team, leading Brooklyn to the Eastern Conference semifinals.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The next season, Harden was an All-Star for the 10th consecutive year but was again the subject of trade rumors. In February 2022, Brooklyn traded the superstar to the Philadelphia 76ers in exchange for a package including draft picks as well as young point guard Ben Simmons. The Sixers were eliminated in the second round of the playoffs with Harden for two years in a row.</p><h2 data-node-id=33 class="body-h3 css-gna8ot e1k3dme10">Trade to the Los Angeles Clippers</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=34 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In June 2023, Harden exercised his player option with Philadelphia worth $35.6 million. However, he became vocal in his criticism of the team’s front office, calling Daryl Morey—now the Sixers’ president of basketball operations—a liar and requesting a trade. Harden missed media day and the opening day of training camp, then didn’t suit up in Philadelphia’s first three games in late October.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=35 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In the early morning of October 31, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1719233117100142839 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="ESPN reported" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">ESPN reported</a> that Philadelphia agreed to trade Harden to the Los Angeles Clippers for a package that included four players and multiple draft selections.
