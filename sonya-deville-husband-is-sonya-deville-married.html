Deville is known for her tough persona and striking looks, which have helped her become a fan favorite in the WWE.</p><p>Deville grew up playing sports, including soccer and lacrosse, and was also involved in mixed martial arts (MMA) training. She attended Seneca High School, where she was a standout athlete and earned a scholarship to play soccer at the University of South Carolina Upstate.</p><p>After college, Deville competed in MMA for several years before transitioning to professional wrestling. She was signed by the WWE in 2015, and began training at the WWE Performance Center in Orlando, Florida. Deville made her debut on the reality show “Tough Enough” in 2015, where she competed for a WWE contract. Although she did not win the competition, Deville impressed WWE officials with her athleticism and toughness, and was offered a contract.</p><p>Deville made her debut on WWE’s main roster in 2017, as part of the faction Absolution, which also included Paige and Mandy Rose. The trio quickly made an impact, dominating the women’s division and earning praise for their performances. Deville’s signature move is the triangle choke, which she used to win several matches.</p><p>In addition to her wrestling career, Deville has also been a vocal advocate for LGBTQ rights. She came out as a lesbian in a 2015 episode of “Tough Enough,” becoming the first openly gay female wrestler in WWE history. Deville has since used her platform to speak out against discrimination and promote equality for all.</p><p>Deville has also appeared on several reality shows, including “Total Divas” and “Miz & Mrs.” She has been open about her struggles with anxiety and depression, and has spoken out about the importance of mental health awareness. In 2020, Deville was the victim of a terrifying incident, when a man broke into her home with the intent of kidnapping and harming her. Deville was able to escape and alert the authorities, and the perpetrator was later apprehended. Deville has since become an advocate for personal safety and self-defense.</p><p>Despite the challenges she has faced, Deville has continued to excel in her wrestling career. She has won several championships, including the NXT Women’s Tag Team Championship with Mandy Rose, and has been a key player in several high-profile matches. Deville’s combination of athleticism, charisma, and advocacy have made her one of the most exciting and dynamic wrestlers in the WWE today.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Sonya Deville Husband: Is Sonya Deville Married?</h2><p>Sonya Deville has been open about her sexual orientation as a member of the LGBTQ+ community. She is recognized as the first female WWE wrestler to publicly come out as gay. Berenato courageously shared her identity as a lesbian while appearing on the reality TV show Tough Enough, which documented the experiences of aspiring wrestlers.</p><p>In her personal life, Berenato is romantically involved with Toni Cassano, a model and fitness enthusiast. Their relationship has been widely discussed in the media and celebrated as an example of queer love and visibility.</p><p>Recently, on February 15, 2023, Berenato and Cassano took a significant step in their relationship by announcing their engagement. Fans and followers of the couple expressed their excitement and support for the happy news, and many sent messages of love and congratulations to the soon-to-be-married couple.</p><p>Berenato and Cassano’s engagement is a significant milestone not only for their relationship but also for the representation and acceptance of LGBTQ+ love in the world of professional wrestling and beyond.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jqymp7GRYrGmwsilo55lmKrAo63NnWSiq12ovK%2FFwGabnq6ZobmmecyaqauhlZl8</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./become-dizzy-with-rapture-nyt-crossword-clue-answer-5-letters-1239953.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Become dizzy with rapture NYT Crossword Clue Answer 5 letters">&larr;
