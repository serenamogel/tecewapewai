She next appeared in the hit series The Flying Nun, before moving on to the big screen. Field won Academy Awards for her performances in Norma Rae (1979) and Places in the Heart (1984), as well as Emmys for the 1976 TV movie Sybil and her later contributions to ER and Brothers & Sisters. Field is also known for her roles in the films Smokey and the Bandit, Forrest Gump and Lincoln, along with her Tony-nominated stage work.</p><h2 data-node-id=3 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Early Life</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Actress, director and writer Sally Margaret Field was born on November 6, 1946, in Pasadena, California. The youngest of two children born to actress Margaret Field, the future star grew up in show business.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After Field's parents divorced, her mother married actor and stuntman Jock Mahoney. Field's stepfather was a strict disciplinarian who expected faithful obedience from Field, her older brother, and half-sister Princess. Mahoney also fought frequently with Field's mother, and the couple's increasingly rocky relationship weighed heavily on the children. Field found solace from her difficult home life by focusing on her extracurricular activities at school. "I'd landed in the drama department, and it just kind of saved me," she later explained to Good Housekeeping magazine.</p><h2 data-node-id=7 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Starting Out in Television: From 'Gidget' to 'The Flying Nun'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After finishing up at Birmingham High School in Van Nuys, California, Field attended an acting workshop at Columbia Studios, which helped launch her film and television career. She landed the leading role in the television series Gidget, which was based on the popular 1959 Sandra Dee film by the same name. Field was only 18 years old when the series debuted in the fall of 1965. Petite and perky, she played a teenager on a quest to find fun with her best friend Larue (played by Lynette Winter).</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The show was canceled after one season, but Field became popular with television audiences â€” so popular, in fact, that the network created another series for her. The Flying Nun starred Field as Sister Bertrille, a nun so light that she could take flight. Field didn't want to take the part, but her stepfather insisted, telling her, "If you turn down this part, you may never work again."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The Flying Nun premiered in September 1967 and soon became a huge hit. Viewers seemed to enjoy following the misadventures of quirky, aerodynamic Sister Bertrille. Behind the scenes, however, Field was miserable. She struggled with the feeling that she would never be considered a serious actress, and the show only magnified that fear.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1968, she married her high school sweetheart, Steven Craig, and soon became pregnant. Her pregnancy was hidden on the series using creative shots and the folds of her billowy nun's habit. Field wouldn't have to hide for long, though; the show was canceled in 1970, after three seasons on the air.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After giving birth to a second child in 1972, Field returned to acting in 1973 with the short-lived sitcom The Girl with Something Extra. Field played a young newlywed with ESP on the show, which lasted only one season.</p><h2 data-node-id=14 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Maturing Roles: 'Sybil' to 'Smokey and the Bandit'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Reconnecting to her craft, Field studied acting at the Actors Studio with famed teacher <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/lee-strasberg data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Lee Strasberg" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Lee Strasberg</a>. Strasberg became a powerful mentor, encouraging Field to move away from her goody-two-shoes television image. This new part of her transformation also included divorcing her husband in 1975.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After several auditions, Field landed a role in 1976's bodybuilding film Stay Hungry with Jeff Bridges and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/arnold-schwarzenegger data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Arnold Schwarzenegger" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Arnold Schwarzenegger</a>. She co-starred as a party girl, a far cry from the innocent characters she played on the small screen. That same year, Field entered a new phase of her career with the television movie Sybil. She showed great emotional range as a woman with multiple-personality disorder, winning her first Emmy Award for her performance.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Returning to the big screen, Field appeared in 1977's Smokey and the Bandit, playing a runaway bride who catches a ride from a trucker (played by <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/burt-reynolds data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Burt Reynolds" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Burt Reynolds</a>). Field and Reynolds became romantically involved on the set of the film, and starred together in several light-hearted comedies, including 1978's Hooper and 1980's Smokey and the Bandit II.</p><h2 data-node-id=19 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Oscar Wins for 'Norma Rae,' 'Places in the Heart'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">It was a dramatic role that brought Field her first Academy Award. In 1979, she starred as a gutsy, determined mill worker who tries to unionize her workplace in Norma Rae. Field received raves for her performance and netted the Best Actress Oscar, beating out the likes of <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/jane-fonda data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Jane Fonda" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Jane Fonda</a>, Marsha Mason, Jill Clayburgh and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/bette-midler data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Bette Midler" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Bette Midler</a>. She continued to take on dramatic fare, starring opposite <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/paul-newman data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Paul Newman" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Paul Newman</a> in 1981's Absence of Malice. In the film, Field played a ruthless journalist.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Re-teaming with Bridges, Field starred in the 1982 romantic comedy Kiss Me Goodbye as a widow trying to rebuild her life. Her character is haunted by her late husband's ghost (played by James Caan), who does not approve of her new love interest. For her work on the film, Field was nominated for a Golden Globe Award.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Field then starred in the 1984 historical drama Places in the Heart, as a widow struggling to keep her family's farm during the Great Depression. The film featured a strong supporting cast, including John Malkovich, Lindsay Crouse, Danny Glover and Ed Harris, and received strong reviews. Nominated for seven Academy Awards, the film won two â€” one for writing, and one for Field as Best Actress.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Field was just as thrilled to be winning her second Academy Award as she was for her first, perhaps even more so. During her acceptance speech, she gushed, "You like me. You really like me." This enthusiastic comment may have been the most memorable quote of the evening, and Field soon found herself the subject of numerous jokes and quips because of it.</p><img alt="Sally Field 1985 Academy Awards Photo Courtesy ABC/Photofest" title="Sally Field 1985 Academy Awards Photo Courtesy ABC/Photofest" width=1835 height=2550 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/sally_field_57th_annual_academy_awards_1985_photo_courtesy_abc_photofest_cropped.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j2">Photo: Courtesy ABC/Photofest</span><p>Sally Field won the Best Actress Oscar for her role in Places in the Heart at the 57th Annual Academy Awards in 1985</p><h2 data-node-id=27 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'Steel Magnolias' to 'Forrest Gump'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Field's career continued to thrive with leading roles in 1985's Murphy's Romance with James Garner and 1988's Punchline. As part of an all-star cast, she appeared in the 1989 Southern drama Steel Magnolias, which included <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/dolly-parton data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Dolly Parton" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Dolly Parton</a>, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/shirley-maclaine data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Shirley MacLaine" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Shirley MacLaine</a>, Daryl Hannah, Olympia Dukakis and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/julia-roberts data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Julia Roberts" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Julia Roberts</a>. Field later produced the 1991 drama Dying Young, which starred Roberts.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In the 1990s, Field took on more character and supporting roles.

She also produced and starred in the 1995 television miniseries A Woman of Independent Means, the story of one woman's life journey during the early 20th century.</p><h2 data-node-id=32 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Writer, Director and Broadway</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=33 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Continuing to work behind the scenes, Field directed and wrote the 1996 holiday television movie The Christmas Tree, which starred Julie Harris. She next directed the 2000 film Beautiful, which starred Minnie Driver as a ruthless beauty queen.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=34 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Returning to series television, Field won accolades for her recurring role on the hit drama ER, playing the bipolar mother of one of the doctors. Field's nuanced performance earned her another Emmy Award â€” this time for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series in 2001.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=35 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 2002, Field fulfilled a personal dream by starring on Broadway in <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/authors-writers/edward-albee data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Edward Albee" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Edward Albee</a>'s The Goat, or Who Is Sylvia? She then had a supporting role in the 2003 big-screen comedy Legally Blonde 2: Red, White & Blonde, starring <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/reese-witherspoon data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Reese Witherspoon" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Reese Witherspoon</a>.</p><h2 data-node-id=36 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Later Successes: 'Brothers & Sisters,' 'Lincoln'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=37 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Before long, Field was contemplating a return to series television. She found great success with the family drama Brothers & Sisters, playing the matriarch of the Walker family. The show resonated with Field's own values, as she told The Saturday Evening Post it was "all about a dysfunctional family whose members deeply love each other and are bonded together. My whole life is about family." She won her third Emmy Award in 2007, for her portrayal of Nora Walker.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=39 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After Brothers & Sisters went off the air in 2011, Field returned to the big screen with the 2012 summer blockbuster The Amazing Spider-Man. She played Aunt May to Andrew Garfield's Peter Parker, a role she later reprised for 2014's The Amazing Spider-Man 2.
